***Fabrizio Gentile, PhD***

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Département d'Astrophysique of the CEA Paris-Saclay. 

My main research interests focuses on the formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe, trying to understand how they assemble their stellar masses and what affects their ability to form stars. You can find some details about my research here, while an updated list of my publications can be found here.

I graduated at the University of Naples in 2022, obtained my PhD at the University of Bologna in 2025, and now I am working in France at the CEA Paris-Saclay. As part of my academic path, I spent a semester visiting the University of Texas at Austin. Further details on my career can be found in my CV, here.

As part of my research, I am involved in several international collaborations such as the COSMOS(-Web) collaboration and the Euclid consortium. You can find more datails about these projects here.

For further information, do not hesitate to contact me here.
