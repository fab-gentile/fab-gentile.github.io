***Fabrizio Gentile, PhD***

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Departement d'Astrophysique of the CEA Paris-Saclay. My research mainly focuses on the evolution of galaxies, trying to understand how these objects evolved from the Big Bang to the current time.

My research involves some of the most advanced telescopes ever built: the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Atacama Large (sub)Millimetre Array (ALMA), and the Euclid satellite.
